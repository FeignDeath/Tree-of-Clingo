Let's play a 5 x 5 mini crossword, where each word should have exactly 5 letters.

{input}

Given the current status, list all possible answers for unfilled or changed words, and your confidence levels (certain/high/medium/low), using the format "h1. apple (medium)". Use "certain" cautiously and only when you are 100% sure this is the correct word. You can list more then one possible answer for each word, but use a new line for each and use the complete format.
